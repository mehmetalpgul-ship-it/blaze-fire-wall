# Blaze Fire Wall

Cross-platform Electron prototype that watches Downloads and Desktop folders and quarantines newly added .exe files while ignoring zip/rar/iso archives.

Quick start:

1. npm install
2. npm run start

Notes:
- This is an early prototype. Access to certain folders may require elevated permissions on some OSes.
